This is a beginner project to help me test out my new knowledge of html. 

Through the odin project I have learned much of the basics of coding in html, using command line on Linux OS, git commands, etc. I am using command line to organize, create, add, and push all of my files to GitHub!


Here I will use this first project as a basis to my html learning, and I hope to use my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, OOP, C++ and Python in my projects in the future.

Overall, this will be a benchmark of my first project that I will be able to compare my progress to in the future.

Thank you!
